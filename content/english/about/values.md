We are a value driven organisation. We try to always act in-line with at least one of our values, and never act in opposition to any of them.

## Local Resilience

Our systems should be well positioned to handle a changing world, including worsening impacts of climate change.

## Empowering Community

We build local skills in our community to manage our infrastructure, and we actively reach out and lend our support to local community groups and projects.

## Awareness of Privilege

We are conscious that the tech industry holds a central and privileged role in the economy, and that we are building infrastructure on unceded aboriginal land.
