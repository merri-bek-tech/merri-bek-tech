Our vision is to have solar-powered server racks at several community facilities around Merri-bek. That means our software services are truly local, and more resilient in the face climate disasters.

## What Do We Need?

{{% steps %}}

### Location Partners

We're looking for about three community locations with a good geographic spread across Merri-bek. Ideally these would represent an cross-section of Merri-bek community life, including council, an established non-profit, and grass roots activism.

Each of these locations would host a server rack, about the size of a bar fridge, as well as a battery and solar setup (or they would already have their own).

These locations would have the ability to provide volunteers with secure access to the rack, without it being easily tampered with by others.

### Funding

We can afford a single location, but would need to grow slowly or find further funding to achieve our full vision
