We are a value driven organisation. We try to always act in-line with at least one of our values, and never act in opposition to any of them.

## Local Resilience
Our systems should be well positioned to handle a changing world, including worsening impacts of climate change.

## People, Not Profit
Our technology choices and services will not support systems where people are enmeshed in surveillance-capitalism business models of giant corporations.

[No Amazon](/docs/principles#no-amazon)

## Empowering Community
We build local skills in our community to manage our infrastructure, and we actively reach out and lend our support to local community groups and projects.

## Awareness of Privilege
We are conscious that the tech industry holds a central and privileged role in the economy, and that we are building infrastructure on unceded aboriginal land.
