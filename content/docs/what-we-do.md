## What is web hosting?

Whenever you use online software (websites, and most phone apps), it's running programs in what is often called "the cloud" - essentially just racks of computers in giant data-centers (secure buildings with good access to internet and electricity). Providing computers to run online software, or to host documents, images and videos served up as websites, is called "hosting".

## So what's community web hosting?

Rather than relying on big data-centers, we want to run key web software on computers physically in Merri-bek, managed by volunteers in Merri-bek who are learning the skills of doing this together.

This wont provide the speed and reliability that big companies need from their hosting, but we don't care. We want to provide local infrastructure by the people, for the people of Merri-bek, and we aren't trying to make any money doing so.
