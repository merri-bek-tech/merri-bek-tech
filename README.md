# Merri-bek Tech Website

This is the website for https://merri-bek.tech

It's built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator.

### ðŸ‘‰ Project Setup

You'll need some dependencies. I find it easiest to use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage versions of dependencies.

The versions needed are listed in `.tool-version`, which means once you've installed `asdf`, you can just run `asdf install` and it should fetch the correct versions.

### ðŸ‘‰ Install NPM packages

Install all the javascript dependencies using the following command.

```bash
npm install
```

### ðŸ‘‰ Development Command

Start the development server using the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
```
